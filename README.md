# my-first-success

I successfully removed elements in replace of semantic elements without distrupting the website, and with accessibility standards. Also, tweaking some of the CSS code. It took be three tries to complete this assignment, and building this project helped me learn and understand each purpose. I learned that classes can be to my own understand and hopefully to anyone who review the code. I solved the code by reading it for what it is and condensing similiar code into one. I was reading it into a little to "closely" which allowed me to overthink the assignment.
